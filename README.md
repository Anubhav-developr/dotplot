# dotplot
Telling a story through dots

## Description
First, take a [look](http://i.imgur.com/hePKkim.gifv).

This is a visualization that can be used to put together a narrative about somewhat complex data. It's most useful when one would like to progress linearly through facets of the data.

We use it primarily for showing survey results, but it could be extended to other uses.

Built with [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)

## TODO
* Create a backend system that allows users to create an instance of the viz without coding skills
* Aesthetic improvements
* Color-switching UI
* Code clean up
